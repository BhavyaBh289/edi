was given in consequence of such fear or misconception; or
Consent of insane person.—if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or

may cause, or be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or
on whose behalf the consent is given.
Illustration
Causing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman) is offence independently
of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of such harm”;
and the consent of the woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act."
"92. Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent.—Nothing is an offence by
reason of any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without
that person's consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent,

him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit: Provided—
Provisos. First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or the
attempting to cause death;

cause hurt, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt;
Fourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing of
which offence it would not extend.
Illustrations
(a) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. A, a surgeon, finds that Z requires to be trepanned. A, not intending Z's
death, but in good faith, for Z's benefit, performs the trepan before Z recovers his power of judging for himself. A has committed
no offence.
(b) Z is carried off by a tiger. A fires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill Z, but not intending to kill Z,
and in good faith intending Z's benefit. A's ball gives Z a mortal wound. A has committed no offence.
(c) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an operation be immediately performed.
There is not time to apply to the child's guardian. A performs the operation in spite of the entreaties of the child, intending, in
good faith, the child's benefit. A has committed no offence.
(d) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket. A drops the child from the housestop,
knowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child's
benefit. Here, even if the child is killed by the fall, A has committed no offence.
Explanation.—Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of sections 88, 89 and 92."

shock. A has committed no offence, though he knew it to be likely that the communication might cause the patient's death."
"94. Act to which a person is compelled by threats.—Except murder, and offences against the State
punishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by
threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person
will otherwise be the consequence: Provided the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a
reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which
he became subject to such constraint.
Explanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being beaten, joins a
gang of dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the ground of
his having been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law.
Explanation 2.—A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant death, to do a
thing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of
a house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the benefit of this exception."
"95. Act causing slight harm.—Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to
cause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of
ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm.

which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass."
"98. Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, etc.—When an act,
which would otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of
maturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by
reason of any misconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence
against that act which he would have if the act were that offence.
Illustrations
(a) Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence. But A has the same right of private
defence which he would have if Z were sane.
(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A.

which he would have if Z were not acting under that misconception."

There is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension

attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that

such act.]"

committing of which, or the attempting to commit which occasions the exercise of the right of private
defence, be theft, mischief, or criminal trespass, not of any of the descriptions enumerated in the last

than death."
"105. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of property.—The right of

attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or as long as the fear of instant death or

offender continues in the commission of criminal trespass or mischief.
The right of private defence of property against house-breaking by night continues as long as the
house-trespass which has been begun by such house-breaking continues."
"106. Right of private defence against deadly assault when there is risk of harm to innocent
person.—If in the exercise of the right of private defence against an assault which reasonably causes the
apprehension of death, the defender be so situated that he cannot effectually exercise that right without
risk of harm to an innocent person, his right of private defence extends to the running of that risk.
Illustration
A is attacked by a mob who attempt to murder him. He cannot effectually exercise his right of private defence without firing
